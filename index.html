      <p class="text-muted">A playground has been built in both the senior and the junior building. The junior building playground has a basketball playing court and some rides like a swing, a slide, etc. But the senior building playground is quite large compared to the junior building one. Enough space to play any outdoor games.</p>

They have a music hall where they teach students to sing. A movie hall for keeping the students entertained by making them watch good movies. A assembly hall for different assemblies. With studying, this school provides a facility for students to also do extra co-curricular activities. Students get chance to participate in assemblies and enough time to be fully prepared for their performance. In junior building, the teachers host the assemblies but in senior building, students get chance to host.</p>

        <h4>Extra Classes</h4>
        <img src="https://img.freepik.com/darmowe-wektory/dzieci-i-nauczyciel-w-klasie-pedagog-szkolny-prowadzi-lekcje-z-grupa-uczniow-we-wnetrzu-klasy-edukacja-kreskowka-szczesliwy-patrzac-koncepcja-uczniow_176411-892.jpg?size=626&ext=jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xm-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The school added extra class facilities for weak students to help them understand topics clearly. These classes usually take place after the normal classes end. Everything started during the pandemic. Weak students are advised to take extra classes and then its their choice they will take or not. In this way, all students become doubt free. Each student is different. They have their own thinking capacities and a different way of interpreting information. Some students understand the concepts at one go but some don’t. They may not even approach for help, thinking what their fellow classmates will think about them. In extra classes, teachers understand the student’s need and even the students open up and freely consult the teacher for help. They would help brush up and give more clarity on certain concepts to students just before the exams. This way they can remember concepts better and reduce their stress levels. So although they may be a bit time consuming but can be really helpful to students. No need to pay any additional amount or fees for such classes. So it’s like an opportunity for students to learn more at school at no extra cost. It helps students increase their knowledge and that too for free.</p>

      <h4>Coding</h4>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The school added Coding as a extra curricular activity subject after the pandemic. Now if you don't know what is coding, let me tell you. Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things. Now, why learn how to code. The answer to that is we all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code! Learning code makes it possible to imagine the things you want to make and actually build them. And I'm sure you will never regret learning how to code. Like, have you ever met a coder who regretted learning to code? Probably not, because learning to code is fun and empowering! Coding also opens up a whole new community and network for you.</p>
